# Everlasting Time
 A puzzle game about two siblings stuck in seperate times

# Story
  Amber and Noir were very close siblings who shared a deep bond and a love for needlework and crafting. Despite their contrasting personalities, Amber being optimistic and bubbly, and Noir being pessimistic and sarcastic, they were inseperable. Their dream was to open their own workshop and share their passion with others. One day, Amber woke up early, excited to start the day and create something beautiful with Noir. To their surprise, Noir was nowhere to be found. They checked Noir's room, the yard, and even the garden, but Noir was not there. Worried, Amber concluded that Noir must have ventured into the woods, and they hurriedly set off to find them. Meanwhile, Noir had woken up after a short nap, finding themselves alone in the darkness of night. They searched the entire house, calling out for Amber, but they were nowhere to be found. Thinking that Amber might have gone into the woods, Noir made their way there, hoping to reunite with their sibling. As they went into the woods, they saw each other frozen in time.
